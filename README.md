#puppet-icinga2
- - -

This module installs and configures the [Icinga 2 monitoring system](https://www.icinga.org/icinga2/). It can also install and configure [NRPE](http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Monitoring-Agents/NRPE--2D-Nagios-Remote-Plugin-Executor/details) on client systems that are being monitored by an Icinga 2 server. 

The module has only been tested on CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04. Red Hat and other EL derivatives, like Fedora, should work, but have not been tested.
